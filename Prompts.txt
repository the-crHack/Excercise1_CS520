1. Chain-of-Thought (CoT)

Prompt:
{####problem statement}
Lemme thought process you this step by step:
Firstly you will understand what the functions should do
Then, you will analyze the expected inputs and outputs
Next, you will think of how to approach this problem
Finally, you will implement the solution


2. Stepwise Chain-of-Thought (SCOT)

Prompt:
{####problem statement}
Let's solve this using a systematic and proper stepwise approach:
Step 1: Problem Analysis: Understand what the function needs to do and know the
inputs and expected outputs. Determine the main requirements.
Step 2: Algorithm Design: Choose the most appropriate approach or algorithm, take
computational complexity under consideration (should be optimal), and plan the main
logic flow.
Step 3: Edge Case Consideration: Identify potential edge cases (like empty inputs,
single elements.) and design how to handle special scenarios. Consider input
validation as needed.
Step 4: Implementation: Write the function step by step, implement the core logic, and
handle the edge cases so that you donâ€™t fail on unseen test data.
Step 5: Verification: After writing the solution, review for correctness and check if it
fulfills all the requirements. Now I'll implement the function.
